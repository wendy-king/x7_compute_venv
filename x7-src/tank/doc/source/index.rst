Welcome to Tank's documentation!
==================================

The Tank project provides services for discovering, registering, and
retrieving virtual machine images. Tank has a RESTful API that allows
querying of VM image metadata as well as retrieval of the actual image.

VM images made available through Tank can be stored in a variety of
locations from simple filesystems to object-storage systems like the
X7 Chase project.

Tank, as with all X7 projects, is written with the following design
guidelines in mind:

* **Component based architecture**: Quickly add new behaviors
* **Highly available**: Scale to very serious workloads
* **Fault tolerant**: Isolated processes avoid cascading failures
* **Recoverable**: Failures should be easy to diagnose, debug, and rectify
* **Open standards**: Be a reference implementation for a community-driven api

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.  Additional documentation on Tank and other components of X7 can
be found on the `X7 wiki`_.  Also see the :doc:`community` page for
other ways to interact with the community.
