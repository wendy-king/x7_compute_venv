Getting Involved
================

The Tank community is a very friendly group and there are places online to join in with the 
community. Feel free to ask questions. This document points you to some of the places where you can
communicate with people.

How to Join the X7 Community
-----------------------------------

Our community welcomes all people interested in open source cloud computing, and there are no formal
membership requirements. The best way to join the community is to talk with others online or at a meetup
and offer contributions through Launchpad, the wiki, or blogs. We welcome all types of contributions, 
from blueprint designs to documentation to testing to deployment scripts. 

Contributing Code
-----------------

To contribute code, sign up for a Launchpad account and sign a contributor license agreement,
available on the `<http://wiki.x7.org/CLA>`_. Once the CLA is signed you 
can contribute code through the Bazaar version control system which is related to your Launchpad account.

#x7 on Freenode IRC Network
----------------------------------

There is a very active chat channel at `<irc://freenode.net/#x7>`_.  This
is usually the best place to ask questions and find your way around. IRC stands for Internet Relay
Chat and it is a way to chat online in real time. You can also ask a question and come back to the 
log files to read the answer later. Logs for the #x7 IRC channel are stored at 
`<http://eavesdrop.x7.org/irclogs/>`_.

X7 Wiki
--------------

The wiki is a living source of knowledge.  It is edited by the community, and
has collections of links and other sources of information. Typically the pages are a good place
to write drafts for specs or documentation, describe a blueprint, or collaborate with others.

`X7 Wiki <http://wiki.x7.org/>`_

Tank on Launchpad
-------------------

Launchpad is a code hosting service that hosts the Tank source code. From
Launchpad you can report bugs, ask questions, and register blueprints (feature requests).
