"""Cron script to generate usage notifications for instances neither created
   nor destroyed in a given time period.

   Together with the notifications generated by compute on instance
   create/delete/resize, over that ime period, this allows an external
   system consuming usage notification feeds to calculate instance usage
   for each tenant.

   Time periods are specified as 'hour', 'month', 'day' or 'year'

   hour = previous hour. If run at 9:07am, will generate usage for 8-9am.
   month = previous month. If the script is run April 1, it will generate
           usages for March 1 thry March 31.
   day = previous day. if run on July 4th, it generates usages for July 3rd.
   year = previous year. If run on Jan 1, it generates usages for
        Jan 1 thru Dec 31 of the previous year.
