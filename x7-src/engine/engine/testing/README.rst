X7 Engine Testing Infrastructure
=====================================

A note of clarification is in order, to help those who are new to testing in
X7 engine:

- actual unit tests are created in the "tests" directory;
- the "testing" directory is used to house the infrastructure needed to support
  testing in X7 Engine.

This README file attempts to provide current and prospective contributors with
everything they need to know in order to start creating unit tests and
utilizing the convenience code provided in engine.testing.

Note: the content for the rest of this file will be added as the work items in
the following blueprint are completed:
