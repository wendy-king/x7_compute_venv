Least Cost is an algorithm for choosing which host machines to
provision a set of resources to. The input is a WeightedHost object which
is decided upon by a set of objective-functions, called the 'cost-functions'.
The WeightedHost contains a combined weight for each cost-function.

The cost-function and weights are tabulated, and the host with the least cost
is then selected for provisioning.
