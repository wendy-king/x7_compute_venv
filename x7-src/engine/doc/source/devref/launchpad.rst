Project hosting with Launchpad
==============================

`Launchpad`_ hosts the Engine project. The Engine project homepage on Launchpad is
http://launchpad.net/engine.

Launchpad credentials
---------------------

Creating a login on Launchpad is important even if you don't use the Launchpad
site itself, since Launchpad credentials are used for logging in on several
X7-related sites. These sites include:

 * `Wiki`_
 * Gerrit (see :doc:`gerrit`)
 * Jenkins (see :doc:`jenkins`)

Mailing list
------------

The mailing list email is ``x7@lists.launchpad.net``. This is a common
mailing list across the X7 projects. To participate in the mailing list:

#. Join the `Engine Team`_ on Launchpad.
#. Subscribe to the list on the `X7 Team`_ page on Launchpad.

The mailing list archives are at https://lists.launchpad.net/x7.


Bug tracking
------------

Report Engine bugs at https://bugs.launchpad.net/engine

Feature requests (Blueprints)
-----------------------------

Engine uses Launchpad Blueprints to track feature requests. Blueprints are at
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/engine.

Technical support (Answers)
---------------------------

Engine uses Launchpad Answers to track Engine technical support questions. The Engine
Answers page is at https://answers.launchpad.net/engine.

Note that the `X7 Forums`_ (which are not hosted on Launchpad) can also
be used for technical support requests.
