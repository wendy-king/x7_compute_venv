Welcome to Engine's documentation!
================================

Engine is a cloud computing fabric controller, the main part of an IaaS system.   
Individuals and organizations can use Engine to host and manage their own cloud 
computing systems. Engine originated as a project out of NASA Ames Research Laboratory.

Engine is written with the following design guidelines in mind:

* **Component based architecture**: Quickly add new behaviors
* **Highly available**: Scale to very serious workloads
* **Fault-Tolerant**: Isolated processes avoid cascading failures
* **Recoverable**: Failures should be easy to diagnose, debug, and rectify
* **Open Standards**: Be a reference implementation for a community-driven api
* **API Compatibility**: Engine strives to provide API-compatible with popular systems like Amazon EC2

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree. Additional draft and project documentation on Engine and other components of X7 can
be found on the `X7 wiki`_. Cloud administrators, refer to `docs.x7.org`_.
